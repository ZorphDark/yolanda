          | Hi! I'm a visual artist and designer currently living in the Portland area.

          | I received a bachelorâ€™s degree in the National Academy School of Fine Arts of Havana, Cuba and studied in their University of Arts for another 3 years.
        p
          | I like to discover and experiment new things, and I try to be creative in every possible way in my life. I consider myself as self-motivated, independent, jolly... and I'm passionate. I try to learn at least one thing every day.

          | That's the brief "me", but there is a lot more! If you want to get in touch I'll be happy to hear from you. :)
